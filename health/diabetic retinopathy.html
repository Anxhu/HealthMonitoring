    <h1><u>DIABETIC RETINOPATHY</u></h1>


    <p>Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness world wide. It affects blood vessels of the retina (the innermost layer of the eye), further causing retinal damage and impairment of vision. the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye, leads
        to this condition.</p>
    <h2>What Happens In Diabetic Retinopathy</h2>
    <p>In diabetic retinopathy, the blood vessels in the retina get blocked and start leaking fluid. In others, irregular new blood vessels Irregular new blood vessels grow which lead to vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachments. These changes result in
        vision loss and finally blindness.

    <h2>Symptoms </h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="lielement">Floaters, Spots, or Strings</li>
        <li class="lielement">Blurry Vision</li>
        <li class="lielement">Fluctuating Vision</li>
        <li class="lielement">Poor Color Vision & Contrast</li>
        <li class="lielement">Difficulty in seeing at Night</li>
        <li class="lielement">Blind Spots in Field of Vision</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="lielement">Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT)</li>
        <li class="lielement">Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)</li>
        <li class="lielement">Retinal Laser / Green Laser</li>
        <li class="lielement">Anti VEGF Molecules</li>
        <li class="lielement">Sutureless 23/25 G Vitrectomy</li>
        <li class="lielement">Cornea Transplants</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Retinal Laser / Green Laser</h2>
    <p>Retinal Laser / Green Laser is a very effective management tool treatment option in diabetic retinopathy. It is helpful in treating leaking blood vessels and prevent further progression of the disease to the unaffected / healthy areas of retina.
    </p>
    <h2>Anti VEGF Molecules</h2>
    <p>Anti VEGF drugs block VEGF action and slow down the damage being caused by neovascularisation, further slowing down the vision loss and also improving it in early cases. Topical anesthetic eye drops are instilled and AntiVEGF drug is injected into
        the eye. It is a painless daycare procedure and one may resume his routine activities from the very next.
    </p>
    <h2>Sutureless 23/25 G Vitrectomy</h2>
    <p>With the availability of new advanced 23G/25G vitrectomy systems, now itâ€™s possible to provide sutureless vitrectomy treatment to retina patients. This enables patients to recover relatively faster with lesser discomfort than the conventional techniques
        available earlier. It also reduces the time taken for the surgery.
