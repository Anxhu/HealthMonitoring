    <h1><u>RETINAL DETACHMENT</u></h1>


    <p>Retinal detachment is an emergency condition in which the inner most layer of eye (retina) gets detached from choroid (middle layer of eye)</p>
    <h2>What Happens In Retinal Detachment</h2>
    <p>The detached retina is a serious and sight-threatening experience, occurring when the retina becomes separated from its primary supportive tissue. The retina cannot work when these layers are detached. And unless soon the retina is reattached, permanent
        vision loss may result.

    <h2>Risk Factors Of Retinal Detachment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="lielement">Myopia Extreme nearsightedness</li>
        <li class="lielement">Ocular Trauma</li>
        <li class="lielement">Eye Surgery</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Myopia Extreme nearsightedness</h2>
    <p>Do you struggle reading road signs and recognizing faces from distance? You could be suffering from myopia, otherwise known as nearsightedness. High levels of nearsightedness also can cause retinal detachment. This is because highly nearsighted people
        typically have longer-than-normal eyeballs with thinner retinas that are more prone to detachments.
    </p>
    <h2>Ocular Trauma</h2>
    <p>Trauma may induce tears/breaks in retina which can lead to retinal detachment. The most common cause of monocular blindness in young patients is complications from ocular trauma. Such complications include traumatic retinal detachment (RD).
    </p>
    <h2>Eye Surgery</h2>
    <p>A retinal detachment happens when fluid gets through a fine tear in the retina, allowing it to detach abnormally from the back wall of the eye. However, some of the eye surgeries may enhance the risk of having retinal detachment e.g. history of surgery
        for eye trauma, complicated cataract surgery etc.

    <h2>Retinal Detachment Surgery</h2>
    <p>All the patients with retinal detachments must undergo surgery for repositioning of the retina in its right place. Otherwise, the retina may lose its ability to function, which will result in permanent blindness. The method by which retinal detachment
        is settled depends upon characteristics of the detachment. Our retina experts will opt for sutureless vitrectomy / scleral buckling as per the need of a particular case.
    </p>
    <h2>Scleral buckling Surgery</h2>
    <p>This surgical procedure includes putting a flexible band (scleral buckle) around the eye to combat the force that detaches out the retina. The fluid below the detached retina is drained, which helps the retina to settle back into its normal position.
    </p>
    <h2>Vitrectomy Procedurey</h2>
    <p>This procedure is commonly used to repair a detachment of the retina. The vitreous fluid that holds the retina is removed from the eye and is replaced by a gas bubble / oil bubble to keep the retina in place. while the gas bubble slowly gets replaced
        by aqueous of the eye, oil bubble is required to drained by another surgical procedure called silicon oil removal (SOR) at a later date. Vitrectomy may some time requires to be combined with scleral buckling.
    </p>
    <h2>Pneumatic Retinopexy Procedure</h2>
    <p>During this procedure, in combination with retinal laser or cryotherapy, a gas bubble is injected into the vitreous cavity of the eye.The gas bubble drives the detached retina in place against the supporting layer underneath. Our retina experts may
        suggest the patients to maintain a certain head positioning for few days. The gas bubble gets replaced by the aqueous of the eye gradually.
